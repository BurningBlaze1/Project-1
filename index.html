                <p>Subaru is a Japanese streamer that does livestreams using a face-tracking virtual avatar, under the
                    Vtubing company, "Hololive". Cool, right?</p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    The joke was even taken further when she appeared on stream as a 3D render of a little
                    white duck wearing her signature baseball cap. Since then she has embraced being associated with a
                    duck being used as her mascot.</p> <br>
